# Deliverables:
# 1: a tidy data set as described below
# 2: a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
# 3: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed 
#    to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
# 4: You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts.

# Instructions:
# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
# 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
